			<h4>Sophomore in Greenville, South Carolina</h4>
			
		I am a sophomore at Bob Jones University studying Cinema Production. 
		I work in the Box office selling tickets for upcoming fine art events.

<p> I enjoy several things. While I don't get the chance when I'm at school, I absolutely love
camp fires. If I could every day, I would make a fire at least once a day.

When I was younger I used to make Lego stop motion videos called brickfilms. My Youtube channel is called GreyBrickProductions. 
Here is a link to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GreyBrickProduction">channel</a>. During my short
career I was featured on <a href="https://www.ikitmovie.com">ikitmovie</a>, which is a stopmotion software website.
Actually, stop motion and visual effects is what got me involved in the world of cinema. Since then, I have enjoyed
making my own short films in my cinema classes.
